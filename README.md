## Installation

To start this challenge, I first defined my variables I would need.  I then created an array to hold all of my questions and answers.  After that, I went ahead and made functions for my quiz, scoring, and how it runs.

## Usage

To play the quiz, simply press start.  Then go ahead and choose from the multiple choice answers whatever you think is correct. At the end of the quiz, please press submit!
